Performance
===========

treeweave is built so the eval path is cheap: a fitted approximant is a tree of
low-order polynomial panels, and a point evaluation is a leaf lookup plus a small
fixed-degree polynomial. A few things are worth knowing to get the most out of
it.

Batch over scalar
-----------------

The batch entry points (``treeweave_batch`` / ``treeweave_sorted`` /
``treeweave_transposed`` in C; calling the fitted object with an array in the
bindings) amortize leaf lookup and vectorize the polynomial evaluation across
points. Prefer them to a scalar loop whenever you have more than a handful of
points.

This matters most in MATLAB/Octave, where single-point eval carries an extra
per-call overhead inherent to the mwrap binding layer (not treeweave) — see
:doc:`/known-issues`. The batch path amortises it to ~zero.

The sorted fast path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The general batch path first counting-sorts the inputs by leaf so each leaf's
points are contiguous, runs one vectorized Horner stream per leaf, then permutes
the results back to the caller's order. When the inputs are *already* ascending,
that sort and permute-back are pure overhead. The ``sorted`` path skips them and
streams straight through the leaves — ~3–4× faster on a presorted 1-D batch.

What the fast path really needs is that the *leaf-id* sequence be monotone — the
points already grouped by leaf. It is exposed only for ``input_dim == 1`` for two
reasons:

- **Cheap precondition.** In 1-D ascending ``x`` guarantees monotone leaf ids, so
  the caller has a trivially checkable promise. In 2-D/3-D no single-axis sort
  makes leaf ids monotone (you'd need a space-filling / per-tree bin order
  treeweave doesn't expose), so there is no caller-side guarantee to offer.
- **Diminishing payoff.** Per-point eval is a tensor-product Horner sweep of
  ``K**n - 1`` FMAs, so the work grows as ``K**n``. In 1-D the polynomial work
  (~``K`` FMAs) is comparable to the O(1) sort + scatter per point, so dropping
  the sort wins ~3–4×. In 2-D/3-D the ``K**2`` / ``K**3`` FMAs dominate and the
  sort is a small fraction of the cost — skipping it would barely move the
  needle. So an ND fast path would be both hard to guarantee and low-value; the
  plain ``batch`` path is the right tool there.

This is worth reaching for because many workloads hand you ascending ``x`` for
free:

- **Regular grids / linspace** — plotting, lookup tables, and resampling sweep a
  domain left to right.
- **Quadrature** — Gauss/Chebyshev/Clenshaw–Curtis abscissae come out in
  ascending order.
- **Time marching** — ODE/PDE integrators and signal processing advance
  monotonically in ``t``.
- **Parameter sweeps** — continuation methods and line searches step one
  coordinate monotonically.

The caller promises ``x[i] <= x[i+1]``; treeweave does not verify it, so unsorted
input on this path yields wrong values (not an error). When in doubt, use the
plain batch path — it sorts internally and is always correct. Both NaN-fill
out-of-domain points.

The leaf-table fast path
------------------------

``PolyTree::find_leaf_id`` has a SIMD-quantize + table-lookup fast path: one
``vcvttpd2qq`` (or scalar ``vcvttsd2si``) per point plus one ``uint32_t`` load
from a ``2^(input_dim * D)``-entry table, in place of recursive tree descent.
The table is built automatically when ``input_dim * D <= 16`` bits of leaf index
*and* the tree refined uniformly to depth ``D``.

For smooth functions, tolerance-based refinement usually stops early and the
tree never reaches uniform depth, so the fast path stays off. To drive it on:
tighten ``tol`` until refinement is uniform, or set ``min_uniform_depth``
explicitly. ``Function::print_stats()`` reports ``Leaf table: live (N entries,
K KiB)`` or ``Leaf table: descent-only``. Table memory grows as
``2^(input_dim * D) * 4 B`` (capped ~256 KiB; past that the table is skipped).

Memory and degree
-----------------

- Tightening ``tol``, raising ``max_depth`` / ``max_memory_mib``, or enabling
  ``allow_max_depth_leaves`` all increase the leaf count and therefore memory.
- The default leaf degree (7) was chosen by a SIMD tuning campaign as the best
  across architectures and dimensions — the only spill-free degree in the
  register-pressured wide cells. Override it (C++ ``fit<N>``) only with
  measurements in hand.
- Oscillatory or rapidly-varying functions can use a *lot* of memory. If your
  function is periodic, fit one period.

Multi-threading
---------------

A fitted object is immutable; chunk your inputs and call the eval path from
multiple threads (disjoint output slices). treeweave does not parallelize
internally, which is what makes that contract safe.

Cross-language throughput and latency
--------------------------------------

The same fit (the Riemann-zeta sum ``zeta(s) = sum_k k**-s``, summed the honest
way — stop once the tail drops below ``1e-10`` relative, capped at 160 terms — on
``[2, 10]`` to a ``1e-10`` relative tolerance) is benchmarked from every binding
(C, C++, Fortran, Python, Julia, Octave, JavaScript), against recomputing that
sum. Even that minimal native eval is tens-to-hundreds of ``pow``\ s, so treeweave
wins in every mode — including scalar. Each chart is a
horizontal bar per language; read it by comparing a language's treeweave bar to
*its own* native bar, both measured in the same process. Each bar is labelled
with the within-language **speedup** (native = ``1×`` baseline, treeweave =
``N×``), while the axis carries the absolute metric. Absolute Mevals/s across
languages is **not** comparable — the matrix spreads languages over different CI
runners — so the axis is log-scaled and the within-language pair is the
meaningful comparison. The charts are regenerated by the ``benchmark-showcase``
CI matrix.

Batch vs sorted batch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

treeweave's plain batch path against its sorted-batch fast path, per language.
The plain ``batch`` path counting-sorts the query points by leaf before
evaluating; the ``sorted batch`` path takes points already in ascending order
(1-D only) and streams straight through the leaves, skipping that sort — which
is what these bars isolate.

Because each native eval recomputes the whole sum, treeweave wins in every mode.
