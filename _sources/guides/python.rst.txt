Install
-------

Install the latest release from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install treeweave

The wheel bundles the C ABI statically; the x86-64 wheel dispatches SSE4.2 /
AVX2 / AVX-512 at runtime. NumPy is the only dependency.

To test an unreleased change, every push to ``main`` publishes a staging wheel
(``X.Y.Z.devN``) to `TestPyPI <https://test.pypi.org/project/treeweave/>`_;
install it with TestPyPI as the primary index and real PyPI for the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ \
               --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ treeweave

Minimal example
---------------

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import treeweave

   N = 1000                           # zeta_N(s) = sum_{k=1..N} k**-s
   ks = np.arange(1.0, N + 1.0)

   def f(x):                          # x is a length-`dim` sequence
       return np.sum(ks ** (-x[0]))   # expensive; fit once, eval a polynomial

   approx = treeweave.fit(f, 2.0, 10.0, tol=1e-10)
   print(approx)   # dtype, dim, out_dim, memory_usage

   # The fit domain is [a, b); evaluating exactly at the upper corner b is
   # allowed as a convenience and returns the boundary value (not NaN).
   xs = np.linspace(2.0, 10.0, 11)   # includes the endpoint b = 10.0
   ys = approx(xs)                    # batch eval; returns an ndarray
   ref = np.array([f([s]) for s in xs])
   assert np.max(np.abs(ys - ref) / np.abs(ref)) < 1e-8

``fit`` infers the input/output dimensions by probing the callable, so the
common case is just ``fit(f, a, b, tol=...)``. The fitted object is called
directly for a single point or a batch. A C++ fit failure surfaces as a native
Python exception.

Evaluation routes
-----------------

Calling the fitted object dispatches on the shape of its argument, and two
keyword flags select the fast paths:

.. code-block:: python

   approx(3.5)                       # single point  -> scalar (or (out_dim,))
   approx(xs)                        # batch (N,)     -> (N,) / (N, out_dim)
   approx(xs, sorted=True)           # promise xs is non-decreasing, xs[i] <= xs[i+1] (dim == 1)
   approx(xs, transposed=True)       # batch -> (out_dim, N)  (requires out_dim > 1)

``sorted=True`` skips treeweave's internal counting-sort and is ~3–4× faster when
you can promise ``xs`` is ascending — common for ``linspace`` grids, quadrature
nodes, and time series. The promise is unchecked: unsorted input gives wrong
values, so use the plain batch path when unsure. ``transposed=True`` returns each
output component in its own contiguous row. Out-of-domain handling is uniform
across paths: evaluating exactly at ``b`` returns the boundary value, and every
other point outside ``[a, b]`` — below ``a``, above ``b``, or ``NaN``/±Inf —
returns ``NaN``.

Multi-dimensional fits
----------------------

Pass sequence corners; the callback receives a length-``dim`` row and returns a
scalar or a length-``out_dim`` sequence:

.. code-block:: python

   def bump(x):
       return math.exp(-100 * (x[0] - 0.5) ** 2 - (x[1] - 0.5) ** 2)

   approx = treeweave.fit(bump, [0.0, 0.0], [1.0, 1.0], tol=1e-8)
   y = approx(np.array([[0.4, 0.6]]))   # shape (N, dim) -> (N, out_dim)

Build from source
-----------------

   cmake --preset bindings-python
   cmake --build build/bindings-python -j
   ctest --test-dir build/bindings-python -R python_treeweave
