# How treeweave works

Treeweave turns an expensive function `f(x)` into a cheap lookup by precomputing
a **piecewise polynomial approximation** on an **adaptive tree**. Cost: memory
plus a one-time fit. Payoff: every later call is a tree descent followed by
a degree-7 polynomial evaluation.

```
   user calls fn(x), fn(x), fn(x)... a million times.

## Phase 1 — fit: adaptive paneling

Start with the whole domain as one box. Try to fit a degree-D polynomial
(monomial basis, via polyfit, sampled at Chebyshev nodes). If error too large,
split into `2^Dim` children and recurse.
Stop when each leaf passes the tolerance check.

Three classical choices make this work, each one a deliberate piece of
numerical-analysis folklore (see [Background](#background-and-further-reading)):

- **Chebyshev nodes, not equispaced.** Sampling `f` at the Chebyshev points
  (end-clustered) avoids the Runge phenomenon — the edge oscillations that make
  a high-degree fit on equispaced nodes diverge. On each panel the error then
  converges *exponentially* in the degree for an analytic `f`.
- **Monomial basis at low degree.** Treeweave keeps the polynomial in the plain
  monomial basis `Σ cₖ xᵏ`. That is famously a bad idea at high degree, but it
  is "easy, fast, accurate" at the low degrees treeweave actually uses
  (degree ≈ 7, well under the `n ≲ 30` regime where the monomial Vandermonde
  solve stays well-behaved). Horner evaluation of a monomial is a tight FMA
  chain that maps directly onto a SIMD register lane (Phase 3).
- **Adaptive panels, not one global fit.** A small enough panel near a rapid
  change or near-singularity is locally accurate, so refining only where `f` is
  hard is far cheaper than one global high-degree interpolant. The split-until-
  `max err ≤ tol` test is exactly the adaptive-paneling idea.

```
   1D example, fitting f on [a, b]:

                           root [a, b]
                         deg-8 fit FAILS
                      split into 2 children
                                │

             ── leaf ──                  split again
                                              │
                                    ┌─────────┴─────────┐
                                    │                   │
                                    RL                  RR
                                [mid, q]             [q, b]
                                fit OK ✓            fit OK ✓
                               ── leaf ──          ── leaf ──
```

Each leaf is one box from the original bracket-view paneling: root → split into
`L` (fits) and `R` (fails) → `R` splits into `RL` and `RR` (both fit). Internal
nodes (`root`, `R`) carry a `first_child_idx` pointing at the first of their two
children in the flat `nodes_[]` array; leaves (`L`, `RL`, `RR`) carry a
`poly_eval_id` that indexes into `polyfits_[]`. A descent for a query `x` walks
one path from root to leaf, picking the child with `x` on the correct side of
`center` at each level. In ND, swap binary splits for `2^Dim` children per
internal node — quadtree (4) in 2D, octree (8) in 3D.

In 2D / 3D the same idea applies, but each split is into 4 / 8 children
(quadtree / octree).

```
   uniform quadtree         adaptive: more leaves
                            where f varies fast
   ┌───────┬───────┐        ┌───┬───┬───────────┐
   │       │       │        │   │   │           │
   │   .   │   .   │        │ . │ . │     .     │
   │       │       │        ├───┼───┤           │
   ├───────┼───────┤        │ . │ . │           │

   └───────┴───────┘        └───────┴───────────┘
```

The result is stored in two flat arrays (Struct-of-Arrays for cache
locality):

```
   nodes_[]   — the tree (24/32/40 B per node for 1D/2D/3D)
   ┌────┬────┬────┬─────────┬────┬────┬─────────────────────────┐
   │ N0 │ N1 │ N2 │   ...   │ Ni │... │ each Node carries:      │
   └────┴────┴────┴─────────┴────┴────┴─────────────────────────┘
                                        • center (split point)
                                        • first_child_idx
                                            (or 0xFFFFFFFF if leaf)
                                        • poly_eval_id
                                            → polyfits_[id]

   polyfits_[]   — per-leaf monomial coefficients (packed)
   ┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
   │   P0     │   P1     │   ...    │   Pk     │
   └──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

Why flat arrays of indices instead of pointers + children? Because the
descent's bottleneck is L1 load latency (Phase 7 closed at 17.1 cycles per
iteration, IPC 0.88, scheduler-queue full 89%). Packing nodes contiguously
and reading only `first_child_idx` per level minimises the dependent-load
chain.

## Phase 2 — eval: descent

Given a query point `x`, walk down the tree:

```
   x = 0.37 (1D)

   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Node 0:  center = 0.5            │   x < 0.5  → child 0
   │          first_child = 1         │
   └─────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Node 1:  center = 0.25           │   x > 0.25 → child 1
   │          first_child = 5         │
   └─────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ▼
   ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Node 6:  first_child = MAX       │   ◄── leaf!  poly_eval_id = 17
   └─────────┬────────────────────────┘
             │
             ▼
   polyfits_[17].eval(x) → y
```

In ND, the child index is built one bit per axis — one comparison per axis,
4 children per 2D node, 8 per 3D node:

```
   2D quadtree at one level:

   ┌───────┬───────┐         child_idx = (x > cx) << 0
   │  10   │  11   │                   | (y > cy) << 1
   │ (NW)  │ (NE)  │
   ├───────●───────┤         the bullet is (cx, cy), the
   │  00   │  01   │         node's split point.
   │ (SW)  │ (SE)  │
   └───────┴───────┘
```

## Phase 3 — leaf evaluation: tensor-product Horner

The leaf carries monomial coefficients `c[k_0, k_1, ..., k_{n-1}]`.
Evaluation collapses one axis at a time using Horner's rule. Total cost:
**`K^n − 1` FMAs** where `K = degree + 1`.

```
   1D Horner (K = 8):              2D Horner (K = 8):

   y = c[7]                        for j in 0..7:
   for k in 6..0:                      y_j = (1D Horner over axis 1)
       y = y * x + c[k]
                                   y = y_7
   7 FMAs total, single chain.     for j in 6..0:
                                       y = y * x_0 + y_j

                                   63 FMAs total, two nested chains.
```

For 3D the cost is `8^3 − 1 = 511` FMAs per evaluation. The shipped kernel
batches W = 4 targets per call (AVX2 ymm) so the FMA-port pair runs at peak
when the leaf is hot in L1.

## Phase 4 — batched eval: counting sort by leaf

This is what makes treeweave fast on million-point batches. Naive batch:
1M points × independent descents × independent polyfits → terrible cache
behaviour. Optimised path:

```
   xp[N] — caller's points, mixed across leaves:

   ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
   │ L3 │ L0 │ L3 │ L1 │ L0 │ L3 │ L0 │ L1 │ L3 │   each cell tagged with
   └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘   its leaf id

   step 1: descend each x → leaf_ids[i]
   step 2: counting sort → permute into packed buffer:

   ┌────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┐
   │ L0 │ L0 │ L0 │ L1 │ L1 │ L3 │ L3 │ L3 │ L3 │   one contiguous run per
   └────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┴────┘   leaf
    └── L0 run ───┘ └─ L1 ──┘ └──── L3 run ─────┘
           │            │              │
           ▼            ▼              ▼
        polyfit      polyfit        polyfit             ◄── one SIMD batch call
      kernel(L0)   kernel(L1)     kernel(L3)            per leaf, coeffs hot
                                                       in L1.

   step 3: permute outputs back to caller order.
```

Leaf coefficients stay loaded across all points in that leaf's run, so the
AVX2 FMA kernel runs at peak. Per-call scratch (`leaf_ids`, `counts`,
`offsets`, `perm`, `xp_packed`, `out_packed`) is `thread_local` so threaded
callers don't contend.

## What costs what

Phase-7 attribution at 3D deg=7, N = 10^6:

```
                          % of runtime
   tree descent        │█████████████████████  55 %   ◄── L1 load-use bound,
                       │                                  at silicon floor
   polyfit FMA kernel  │████████               20 %

                       0              50               100 %
```

End-to-end ceiling on one P-core: ~7 % of FMA peak (76.8 GFLOPS DP). The
55 % descent is at the load-use latency floor; closing the rest needs
parallel hardware — which is why Phase 8 locks down `operator()`
thread-safety so callers can chunk and thread externally.

## TL;DR

```
   treeweave  =  k-d tree of monomial polynomials
              + flat-array descent (load-use bound)
              + counting-sort batched leaf evaluation
              + thread-safe immutable Function
```

One fit, immutable `Function`, cheap evaluations forever.

## Degree selection: C ABI vs C++ header API

The **C++ header API** (`treeweave::fit<Degree>(...)`) requires the leaf degree
as a compile-time template parameter, letting you tune or override it per
call site. Supported values are any positive integer; 7 is the default
(matches one AVX2 / AVX-512 register lane).

The **C ABI** (`treeweave_fit` for double / `treeweavef_fit` for float in
`treeweave.h` — precision lives in the prefix, FINUFFT/FFTW style) takes no
degree argument. Instead it picks a register-optimal, spill-free degree at
runtime based on the detected CPU vector width. The multi-arch dispatch path —
enabled at build time with `-DTREEWEAVE_C_MULTIARCH=ON` — selects among
compiled-in ISA variants so the best leaf size for the host CPU is used
automatically: on x86 a SSE2/SSE4.2/AVX2/AVX-512 ladder, on aarch64 the single
mandatory NEON64 variant, and on RISC-V an `rvv` variant (best-effort,
untested). See the [Runtime ISA dispatch](guides/dispatch.rst) guide for the
full family selection and the `TREEWEAVE_FORCE_ARCH` override. Accuracy is driven entirely by the
`tol` parameter; the adaptive tree refines until every leaf meets tolerance
regardless of which degree is chosen.

## Background and further reading

The design above is a software realization of standard function-approximation
practice. For an accessible, modern tour of the underlying numerical analysis —
why Chebyshev nodes, why the monomial basis is fine at low degree, and how
adaptive paneling extends to several dimensions — see:

> one and more dimensions*, FWAM7, Flatiron Institute Center for Computational

That talk surveys the exact recipe treeweave automates — "break the domain into
panels, use a fixed-degree interpolant on each, and recursively split panels
until the local error meets the user's tolerance" — and lists
[baobzi](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/baobzi) (treeweave's predecessor)
alongside `HChebInterp.jl` and `Chebfun` as adaptive-interpolation codes. A few
specific points it makes that justify treeweave's choices:

- **Chebyshev nodes defeat the Runge phenomenon** and give exponential
  convergence for analytic functions; the convergence rate is governed by the
  size of the Bernstein ellipse in which `f` is analytic (Runge 1901;
  Trefethen, *Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice*).
- **The monomial basis is "easy, fast, accurate" for degree `n ≲ 30`** even
  though it is ill-advised at higher degree — exactly the low-degree, many-panel
  regime treeweave operates in (Helsing 2008; Shen & Serkh, *SINUM* 2025).
- **Piecewise high-order interpolation on adaptive boxes** (a quadtree in 2D, an
  octree in 3D) is the standard way to beat the `nᵈ` curse of dimensionality in
  low dimensions, at the cost of memory — the trade treeweave makes explicit.

### The math, briefly

On each panel treeweave fits an order-`n` polynomial (degree `n − 1`). Working on
the standard interval `[−1, 1]`, it samples `f` at the `n` **Chebyshev points**

$$
t_j = \cos\!\frac{\pi j}{n - 1}, \qquad j = 0, 1, \dots, n - 1,
$$

which cluster toward the endpoints — the clustering that defeats the Runge
phenomenon. A panel `[a, b]` is reached by the affine map (exactly treeweave's
`midpoint` ± `half_length`)

$$
x = \frac{a + b}{2} + \frac{b - a}{2}\, t, \qquad t \in [-1, 1].
$$

The interpolant is stored in the **monomial basis**, with coefficients `cₖ`
solving the Vandermonde system `V c = f`:

$$
\tilde f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_k\, x^k,
\qquad
V_{jk} = x_j^{\,k}, \quad f_j = f(x_j).
$$

Rescaling each panel to `[−1, 1]` keeps that Vandermonde solve well-conditioned —
which, with the low degrees treeweave uses, is why the monomial form stays
accurate. The approximation error on a panel obeys the classical Chebyshev
bounds:

$$
\lVert f - \tilde f \rVert_\infty =
\begin{cases}
\mathcal{O}(\rho^{-n}) & f \text{ analytic inside the Bernstein ellipse } E_\rho
                          \text{ (exponential)},\\[4pt]
\mathcal{O}(n^{-p})    & f \text{ has } p \text{ continuous derivatives (algebraic)}.
\end{cases}
$$

The adaptive fit (Phase 1) simply subdivides any panel until its measured
$\lVert f - \tilde f \rVert_\infty \le \varepsilon$ (`tol`), so a near-singularity
gets many small panels while smooth regions stay coarse. Evaluation (Phase 3) is
then a tensor-product Horner sweep costing `Kⁿ − 1` FMAs per point, with
`K = n = degree + 1` values per axis.
