/* treeweave_version.h — GENERATED from include/treeweave_version.h.in by
 * cmake/treeweave_generate_version.cmake (single source of truth: the VERSION
 * file at the repo root). The generated copy is committed to the include/ tree
 * so every consumer that already adds include/ to its path finds it; it is
 * regenerated on configure and by the pre-commit hook. Do NOT edit by hand —
 * edit VERSION (or this template) and re-run CMake configure.
 *
 * It is plain C (usable from both treeweave.h and the C++ treeweave.hpp) and
 * carries only the version macros, so it has no dependencies and can be
 * included anywhere.
